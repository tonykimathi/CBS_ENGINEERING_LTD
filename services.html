                <p>
                    EPS stands for expanded polystyrene, which is an industrial product made from expandable
                    polystyrene, which is a rigid cellular plastic containing an expansion agent, usually pentane. An EPS
                    panel is made up of the foam that is sandwiched between two high-tensile steel meshes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The use of EPS is a modern concept which the construction industry in Kenya is adopting in a bid to
                    satisfy the rising demand for affordable housing. According to the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS),
                    the annual demand for new houses is in excess of 150,000; whereas the annual national output of new
                    homes is about 60,000 houses. EPS use in construction is significantly helping to alleviate this deficit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    EPS’s greatest advantage is its light-weight nature which translates to lesser dead weight (structurally
                    speaking), thereby resulting in reduced steel reinforcement and concrete requirements for structures.
                    Consequently, the overall construction costs are significantly lowered as it speeds up the construction
                    process and reduces the labour cost.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    EPS has significant positive environmental impact by reducing CO2 emissions by up to 40% from
                    building construction process and up to 65% during the use of the building (low heat conductivity
                    reduces consumption of energy in heating costs)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    EPS blocks produced from the manufacturing process are cut into panels of sizes, shapes and designs
                    as required. Discussed below are EPS panels used for:
                     Walls
                     Floor slabs
                     Earth fill material
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="text-align: center; font-size: 22pt">A. EPS WALL PANEL</span></p>
                <p>
                    EPS wall panels are manufactured in common sizes of 60mm and 80mm thickness and are used for
                    internal and external walls respectively. However, the client is not limited to these sizes as the
                    technology allows for the manufacture of other thicknesses according to the client’s specifications.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The panels are manufactured by having EPS foam sandwiched between two high tensile steel meshes
                    electro-statically welded together using double steel wire connectors (ties).
                </p>

                    i) Specifications (KS 2620:2015)
                     Density of 15kg/m3
                     Standard panel sizes
                    (1200mm x 3000mm x 80/60mm)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    ii) Site Installation
                    Installation of EPS wall panels requires basic understanding of building technology
                    and training. A thin layer of shotcrete (25-35mm) is applied on both sides of the wall
                    to give it strength and make it behave as a stress-skin panel when loaded axially. EPS
                    wall panels when shotcreted with proper grade of concrete (class 25 or higher)
                    perform as a composite column in bearing axial wall loads.
                    The end user can put a finish that is in accordance to his/her taste.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    iii) Benefits
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Low weight-to-strength Ratio - The wall panel’s core is EPS with a density of approx. 15 kg/m3 against
                    a density of 1800-2200kg/m3
                    for block/stone walling but with the same load resistance as block/stone
                    walling. Therefore, EPS has lower weight-to-strength ratio compared to masonry block/stone walling.
                    EPS wall panels can be used to build structures up to 6 storeys.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Rapid Installation - The low weight of EPS makes it easy to handle on site and to transport to site. EPS
                    ease of handling and installation therefore results in substantive labour savings of up to 30%.
                    The duration of construction is also greatly reduced because the panels are transported to site as
                    already assembled products from the factory.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Convenience & Versatility - EPS wall panels can be manufactured into exact sizes as required by the
                    engineer to specifically suit different project’s requirements.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Environmentally-friendly - The whole production process carried out in a factory does not emit harmful
                    substances into the environment. Since the wall panels are cut to suit the site requirements, there is
                    minimal waste. In addition, wastage reduced as left over material can be recycled.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Thermal Insulation & Sound proofing - Due to its closed air-filled cell structure that inhibits the
                    passage of heat or cold, a high capacity for thermal insulation is achieved.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Waterproof - The EPS wall panel does not absorb moisture and its thermal and mechanical properties
                    are unaffected by dampness, humidity or moisture.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="text-align: center; font-size: 22pt">B. EPS FLOOR PANEL</span></p>
                <p>
                    EPS can be used in construction of reinforced concrete floors using EPS floor panels. Floor panels are
                    manufactured in sizes of 150mm, 190mm, 260mm and 290mm thick panels; or depending on the
                    Engineer’s specifications.

                    ii) Benefits
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Lesser concrete and steel reinforcement – The reduced dead weight resulting from the use of EPS
                    floor panels result in lower stresses especially in the slabs (ribbed) and beams, conversely reducing the
                    steel reinforcement required. This derives savings in the overall costs of floor slab construction vis-a-vis
                    other forms of slab construction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Low weight void former – EPS density of 15kg/m3 allow for light and safe construction works. In the
                    design of ribbed slabs, especially for slabs with big spans, EPS floor panels are ideal for use as a
                    lightweight fill material (void former) as opposed to alternatively such as hollow blocks/hollow pots.
                    The bulk density ratio of EPS to hollow block is 1:30
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Thermal Insulation - Due to its closed air-filled cell structure that inhibits the passage of heat or cold, a
                    high capacity for thermal insulation is achieved.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Waterproof - The EPS wall panel does not absorb moisture and its thermal and mechanical properties
                    are unaffected by dampness, humidity or moisture.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Fire Resistance – EPS 3D panels are manufactured using self-extinguishing polystyrene and with the
                    addition of the concrete layers, combustion is further prevented.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Rapid Installation - The low weight of EPS makes it easy to handle on site and to transport to site.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Compatibility - EPS is completely compatible with other materials used in construction including
                    cements, plasters, salt, fresh water and so on.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Versatility and flexibility - EPS floor panels can be cut into exact depths as required by the structural
                    engineer to specifically suit different project’s requirements. In particular, EPS is ideal for large span
                    slabs, giving the Architect more flexibility in design of bigger functional spaces.
                </p>

                <p><span style="text-align: center; font-size: 22pt">C. EPS AS EARTHFILL MATERIAL</span></p>
                <p>
                    The need for construction of new roads sometimes requires construction over soft or loose soils that are
                    incapable of bearing additional loads. Engineers must identify innovative materials and construction
                    techniques to address the problem of building on soft soils or where sensitive existing utilities or
                    wetlands are present while, at the same time, accelerating construction project schedules. EPS
                    ‘geofoam’ can be used to replace compressible soils or in place of heavy fill materials be used to
                    prevent unacceptable loading on underlying soils and adjacent structures.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    i) Benefits
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    High compressive resistance - The high compressive resistance of EPS geofoam makes it capable of
                    bearing traffic loads associated with secondary roads such as feeder roads connecting rural areas to
                    urban centres within counties and those interconnecting the counties at large.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Reduced time spent on road tests on site - Being an engineered product that has undergone rigorous
                    tests prior to arrival on site, EPS geofoam also saves time during road construction. Moreover, it is easy
                    to handle with no need to use special equipment on site.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Reduced volume of natural fill material requirement - In the use of EPS geofoam as a fill in road
                    embankments and sub-grades, the volume of natural fill materials required in the filling of cuts and
                    embankments is greatly reduced. This leads to lesser amounts of earthworks done and less machinery
                    being mobilized which ultimately reduces the costs of road-construction in terms of labour and capital.
                    The negative impacts of road construction on the environment are also reduced due to need for less
                    natural fill material.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Protection against spills - In some cases, protection against fuel spills on pavements maybe required.
                    In this case, a hydrocarbon resistant geo-membrane can be placed over the uppermost EPS block
                    course to protect the pavement from possible hydrocarbon attack.
                    These technologies are more advanced and specific in other localities globally. Further guidance is
                    available from EPS construction manuals as well as international and local design and specifications
                    guidelines such as EN13163, ASTM D6817 and KS2620: 2015.
