                    <p>
                        CBS ENGINEERING LTD was established in 2015 by business men who have a combined experience in
                        general construction, EPS building, civil construction, mechanical construction, electrical
                        engineering and consulting services.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        CBS ENGINEERING LTD is forward thinking, energetic and dynamic in the construction industry. We
                        are always available with the necessary skills, knowledge and equipment to meet any requirements
                        in the field of general construction, civil construction, mechanical construction and electrical
                        engineering.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We add value by creating ideal outcomes for both property owners and tenants where they love the
                        transformation of their property and maximize the financial returns received. This not only enables
                        us to deliver a dynamic and professional service to our customers, but also gives the client the
                        assurance that their interest is served by members and staff personally to complete projects on time,
                        and to the required quality standards.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Delivering design, tout, refurbishment and construction projects is what we do. Our philosophy is that
                        all successful projects are founded on the professionals responsible for projects and our team is
                        dedicated to understanding our clients' business objectives so that they can create structures which
                        meet their needs.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        CBS ENGINEERING LTD is aligned with all project stakeholders through open communication to ensure
                        we add value and exceed our clients' expectations.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Safe working conditions are a very high priority, not only for our employees, but also for our
                        customers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        With our experience and expertise as building contractors we can tackle large projects with complete
                        confidence. We are also equally adept at handling the smallest jobs.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, no matter how big or small the project, our customers are rest assured that it will
                        be completed on time, within their budget and to the satisfaction of even the most exacting clients.
